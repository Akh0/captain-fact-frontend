  "howTitle": "How does it work?",
  "how": "CaptainFact is a collaborative fact-checking tool for YouTube videos. People help each others to verify as many informations as possible in the following way:\n    1- Video is added on the website.\n    2- Statements are extracted from the video.\n    3- Fact-checkers confirm or refute the statements.\n Facts are then pushed to all CaptainFact's extension users when they watch a YouTube video and soon to all other web medias.",
  "whoTitle": "Who are the fact-checkers?",
  "who": "The fact-checking is done collaboratively. Everyone can share their knowledge to fight against:\n    - inaccuracies and omissions ;\n    - distortions of information (voluntary or not) ;\n    - information put out of context ;\n    - fake news ;\n    - pseudo-sciences, rhetological fallacies, intellectual dishonesty, demagogy, untruths, or other.\n    See the definition of fact checking on Wikipedia. \n    Sign up to participate!"
