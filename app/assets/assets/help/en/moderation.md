The flagging system allows you to report inappropriate content. You're allowed a small number of
flags each day and should use them carefully; Using flags inappropriately can make you loose a lot 
of reputation.

For all content not falling into below categories (racism, sexism, discrimination...etc) that may be
illegal in your country, please use the [censorship request procedure](/help/censorship_requests).


### Spam or commercial content
    
  Anything that has nothing to do with the subject, that tries to sell something or link to
  undesirable content


### Rude language

  This includes the use of sexualized language. Confronting opinions can sometimes be emotionally
  powerful, but try to stay polite.

  
### Personal attack or harassment

  You should always attack the ideas, not the people. Anything like "Are you stupid ?" or mothers
  jokes will not be tolerated. We don't attack moms, ever.
  
  If a troll upsets you vote it down and don't feed it.
