# What is it for ?

Reputation is a way of measuring how much the community trusts you.
Good contributions (commenting, posting facts, adding statements...etc) are rewarded
while negative contributions (bad language, questionable sources...etc) can make
you loose reputation.

Reputation gives you swag and unlocks new [privileges](/help/privileges).
You can earn up to 25 reputation per day (counter resets at midnight).

These rules are subject to change, especially as the number of users grows.
