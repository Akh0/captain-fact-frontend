# Volunteer

CaptainFact is a non-profit project.

If you are a **developer**, a **graphic designer** or a **lawyer** and want to take part in this
project your help could be extremely valuable. Please [contact us !](/help/contact)

We're also looking for people to translate CaptainFact in other languages (es, it, de...etc).

# Open Source

We intend to make this project open source by publishing all the frontend code soon (website +
extension). We'll later publish the server code too but we want to be able to provide a public, 
bullet-proof API to share the data before doing so.
