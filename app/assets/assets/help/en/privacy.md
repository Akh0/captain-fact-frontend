# About my privacy

## Website

 We will **never** sell your personal data (email, name...etc).
 However, you should consider all your interactions (voting, commenting, flagging...) as public.
 
 Also, we don't use any external tracker nor do we implement any social network buttons.
 The only external code we run here is the one for the video player.

## Extension

 You can select whether or not you want to activate videos overlay in one click, using the extension
 popup.
 
 <!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->
 
 If you do activate it, the extension will send a request to CaptainFact for every video you play
 to ask if the video has been fact checked by the community.
 **We do not log these requests**. Privacy is an important matter and this information is not
 pertinent for what we want to offer you.
 
 However, you don't have to trust us : activate CaptainFact only when needed if you don't want to
 use this feature.
