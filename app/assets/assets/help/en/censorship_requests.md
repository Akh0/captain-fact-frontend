# Free speech policy

CaptainFact embraces the view of freedom of speech as a true right, even when what's being said really bother us.
It means that as long as your comment is related to the topic being discussed (no spam) and that you don't attack someone
personally, you can speak freely.

As much as most of us may reject racism, sexism or any other forms of discrimination we believe
**it's not our role to do the police**. With CaptainFact people can vote to sort the comments based
on their quality, thus filtering biased and not properly argued speeches without the need for
censorship.

Furthermore we believe that to convince someone, you first have to hear and understand what he / she
may have to say. There's no point in refusing a debate because of a too wide difference in opinions.

# Censorship requests

**That being said** we also have, as a social platform, legal obligations to conform with the local
laws of the countries we're implanted in. To deal with that, censorship requests should be addressed
to [censorship@captainfact.io](mailto:censorship@captainfact.io). **We will not accept anonymous
requests** and all of them will be **publicly displayed**.
